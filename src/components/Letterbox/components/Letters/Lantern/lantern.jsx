                   Shirley,
                </p>
                <p>
                    I struggle to act as though you are nothing to me when you were so recently everything.
                    I want to know that it hurt you as much as it did me.
                    But at the end of the day I hope that life brings you the fulfillment that you deserve, even if that life is one from which I am absent.
                    A piece of my heart will forever ache at the thought of you.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    I still wonder how you feel and hope that a piece of your heart aches too.
                    Maybe this feeling will fade with time; it's sickening that you cannot speed up the process.
                    Hopefully after anough teary eyed nights we will think of each other and smile.
                    We will focus on the memories we made, the time we shared, and the love we gave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You taught be that nothing in this life is a guarantee.
                    If I had known that night would be the last time I'd see you, I would have held you tighter.
                    I would have kissed you longer.
                    I would have called you baby or darling or something cringier one more time.
                    I would have said one more "I love you" and "goodbye."
                    But those opportunities are gone, as are you.
