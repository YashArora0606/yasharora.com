# Collateralized Romantic Obligations

### On love (or an unrealized lack thereof)

---

Love is an asset backed security.

<!--
- when you buy it someone owes you love over time
- people can default on their payment of love
- we look for securities with high payout because we want the best for ourselves, but often these turn out to be the riskiest investments -->

- we buy and sell individual love loans
- we tend to only have enough capital to invest in one at a time
- Love loans are risky. If your debtor defaults, sure, you'll get back your collatoral (a sense of of freedom, lack of attachments), but will you really be able to sell it again at market value? Or will you quickly auction it off for a fraction of what it's worth (rebounds)? And when you do, although your newfound liquid capital of love is ready to be reallocated, you'll likely find it too risky to make the same type of investment again.

Collateralized love obligations

- hinge, tinder, and bumble bundle these love loans into a collatoralized love obligation, fractionate them into investable pieces, and sell these shares to investors
- and now you get a little piece of love from a lot of different people
- and your risk is hedged by buying shares of this collatoralized love obligation, composed of tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands of lovers
- if one debtor defaults, it no longer hurts the way it used to
- and sure, by sheer quantity of debtors you recieve enough attention to _feel_ as though you're loved
- but you're not _really_ loved by any of them
- because to them you're just an investor
- and to you they're just a number
